				<dt>Machine Learning Experience:</dt><br>
				<dd> Trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) Object Detection Model using OpenCV<br> Trained a robust YOLO object detection model <br>using OpenCV and advanced computer vision techniques.<br>
					Designed and implemented a YOLO model to detect multiple objects in images with a high degree of accuracy.<br>
				</dd><br>
				<dt>UNITY</dt><br>
				<dd>Made a game in unity using javascript and default models<br>the character has to avoid obstacles
				<br>and clear all the levels.
				</dd><br>
				<dt>Blender 3D</dt><br>
				<dd>
					Worked with character animations <br>
					Created realistic environments with the help of geometry nodes(a forest scene)<br><br>
					Here is a  <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jJ4OUYxBaBEooBWRGpyZWhroWezfTMQI?usp=drive_link">link </a>
					to the 3d models/environments I made in blender.

			<h1>Ongoing Projects</h1><hr>
			<dt>Snake Game AI</dt><br>
			<dd> Currently developing a Snake Game AI using Java, focusing on implementing core game mechanics.<br>
				Planning to integrate a pathfinding algorithm so the snake could find the shortest path towards<br> the food source, considering weighted connections.<br>
				Utilizing data structures such as ArrayList and HashMap to represent the game board as a graph.<br>
				Incorporating object-oriented programming principles for modular code and easy maintainability.<br>
				Technologies: Java, Object-Oriented Programming, Graph Representation.

			<h1>Future Projects</h1><hr>
			<dt> Autonomous Boss-Fighting AI for Action Games</dt><br>
			<dd>
				Planning to develop an advanced AI system capable of autonomously engaging and defeating
				challenging bosses within action-oriented games like Dark Souls, Terraria, and Elden Ring.<br> 
				The project involves integrating cutting-edge reinforcement learning techniques and 
				game-specific mechanics to enable the AI to analyze boss patterns, strategize attacks,
				and respond effectively in real-time combat scenarios. <br>The goal is to provide players with 
				the option to witness AI-driven boss battles while maintaining the thrill and intensity of the 
				original gameplay. <br>Anticipated outcomes include enhancing player experience, showcasing AI mastery, 
				and contributing to the field of game AI development.<br>
