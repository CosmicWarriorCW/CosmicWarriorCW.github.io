			<h1>Ongoing Projects</h1><hr>
			<dt>Snake Game AI</dt><br>
			<dd> Currently developing a Snake Game AI using Java, focusing on implementing core game mechanics.<br>
				Planning to integrate a pathfinding algorithm so the snake could find the shortest path towards<br> the food source, considering weighted connections.<br>
				Utilizing data structures such as ArrayList and HashMap to represent the game board as a graph.<br>
				Incorporating object-oriented programming principles for modular code and easy maintainability.<br>
				Technologies: Java, Object-Oriented Programming, Graph Representation.

			<h1>Future Projects</h1><hr>
			<dt> Autonomous Boss-Fighting AI for Action Games</dt><br>
			<dd>
				Planning to develop an advanced AI system capable of autonomously engaging and 
				defeating challenging bosses within action-oriented games like Dark Souls, Terraria, and Elden Ring. 
				The project involves integrating cutting-edge reinforcement learning techniques
				and game-specific mechanics to enable the AI to analyze boss patterns, strategize attacks,
				and respond effectively in real-time combat scenarios. The goal is to provide players with 
				the option to witness AI-driven boss battles while maintaining the thrill and intensity of the 
				original gameplay. Anticipated outcomes include enhancing player experience, showcasing 
				AI mastery, and contributing to the field of game AI development.
